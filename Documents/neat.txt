NEAT Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies
-> NE algorithm 
-> stepwise optimization and complexification of NNs
-> old approaches only connections -> with neat -> topology

-> compex networks (full connected) -> speed and accurancy of learning gets worse with backprob (with NE unkonwn)
-> one doesn't have to try any more by hand how many hidden nodes are needed

TWEANs Topology and weight evolving Artificial Neural Networks
GA_> corssover + mutate. Evolutionary Programmin -> only mutate

Neat direct encoding  -> not indirect cause : might bias search in unpredictable way. no one to one mapping indirect ->direct

Copeting convention problem 2 networks produce same result but different strucutre -> crossover likely to 	produce damaged offspring


Allel -> ausprägung von homologen genen.   gen: blütenfarbe : allel 1 rot, allel 2 blau
synapsis: anordnung homologer gene  -> in neat artificial synapsis -> wenn gleichen ursprung

protecting innovation with specitation (specitation = niching)
-> new connection or new node doesn't normally lead to immediatelly to better performance, needs time to develop weight, connextions
-> innovative structure own species (niches)
-> explicit fitness sharing -> individuals with similar genomes share fitness payoff (auszahlung). -> neat
-> implicit fitness sharing -> similar fitnes
fintess sharing -> number of individuals that can exist at fitness peak is dependend on the size of the peak -> small peak many individuals, -> shared payoff gets less.
-> here neat, wide of good fitnesses with similar genomes

Neat:
genetic encoding
List connection genes , each refers to 2 node genes, has expressed flag, and innovation number, weight
Mutations
-> weight  mutated with prob.
-> Structure mutations:
	add connection mutation -> new connection gene random weight two unconnected cells
	add cell mutation -> existing connection is split , old connection disabled, 2 new connections added. in new node w =1 out new node w = previous connection -> minimize initial effect of mutation. new structure behaves like old one

Historical Markings
two genes with same origin must represent same structure (but different weigths). both derived from same acestral gene
new gene appears globel innovation counter applied und incemented. only for connection genes,(add node mutation => two new connection genes). Mating -> innovation number does not change. fixed.
If same connection is added more times in one generation, than same innovation number

Crossing over: Genes with same innovation number are lined up (synapsis) -> matching . Gene with no match disjoint -> inside the range of othr parents innumbers. excess -> outside range of other parents in numbers.
matching genes choosen randomly. disjoint and excess from fitter parent (same fintess -> also randomly), small change that inherited gene is disabled	
-> no expensive topology analysis

Specitation:
Distance measure of 2 structures:
fomular dependig on c1*excess genes/N + c2*disjoint genes/N + c3*average weight differences of matching genes.(avaerage over differences of 2 genes)
N = numebr of genes in larger genome.
Distance thrshold determines wether same species

Ordered List of species
each generation genomes are sequentially added to species. Existing species (prev generation) represented by random member. 
genome -> first fit by compare with representer -> add  -> no overlap of species . if genome not compatible with any representer -> placed in new species.

Explicit fitness sharing-> prevent one species to take over entire populations
adjusted fitness = f_i / num of species member.
if species gets to large -> fitness gets less
Reproduction:
Depending  propotional of sum of adjusted fitnesses in population number of offpsrings are calculated. (generation size fixed)
1. eliminating lowest perfoming members of all population
2. Entire population replaced by  offspring of remaining genomes
(elitism also possible)


Minimal Structure -> minimal dimensionality (each weight one dimension)
-> start only inputs connected to all outputs


Markovian, non markovian by networks
markovian network independend from last input --> no backwards connections
non markovian network independend from last inputs -> backward connections, loops...


Parameters:
80% weight mutation. 90% uniformly perturbed ?? whats this? 10% new random weight
Best generation survives completely
25% that inherited disabled gets enabled
interspecies mating rate  0.0001
new node 3% link 5%
steepend sigmoidal activaition function
