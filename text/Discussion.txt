Problems in Sebastians Model:
-no fixed state for reached angle
-time decoding interrupts signal
-only partly used noice (not for all neurons)
-learning phase: learning max angles leads to ignored overshoot. One doesn't have to hit the angle precicsely. 
- model one approach for a motor cortex, there might be thousands different ones. No proove to be correct.
NEAT:
-> we do it that way but don't tell why
-> same genomes should be held over all generations

HyperNEAT:
